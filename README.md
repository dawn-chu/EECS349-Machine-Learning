## Problem Set 2
In this assignment you will work in groups of 2 or 3 to implement a decision tree learning algorithm and apply it to a synthetic dataset. You will also implement a pruning strategy in your algorithm. You will be given labeled training data, from which you will generate a model. You will be given labeled validation data, for which you will report your model's accuracy. You will also be given unlabeled test data for which you will generate predictions.

## Problem Set 3
neural network and Char-RNN in TensorFlow
